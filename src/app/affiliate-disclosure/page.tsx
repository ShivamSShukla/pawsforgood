          <h2>Amazon Associates Program Participation</h2>
          <p>
            Paws For Good ("we," "us," or "our") is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program 
            and the Amazon EU Associates Programme, affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for 
            sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk.
          </p>

          <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
          <p>When you click on an affiliate link on our website and make a purchase on Amazon:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You are redirected to Amazon's website</li>
            <li>You complete your purchase directly with Amazon</li>
            <li>Amazon pays us a commission on qualifying purchases</li>
            <li><strong>You pay the same price</strong> - there is no additional cost to you</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Commission Rates</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Commission rates are set by Amazon, not by us</li>
            <li>Rates vary by product category (typically 1-10%)</li>
            <li>Rates can change at Amazon's discretion</li>
            <li>We have no control over Amazon's commission structure</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What We Do With Commissions</h2>
          <p><strong>100% of affiliate commissions are used to purchase food for street dogs and cats.</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Zero portion kept for operational costs or profit</li>
            <li>Commissions are pooled weekly/biweekly</li>
            <li>Bulk food purchases maximize impact</li>
            <li>All receipts and proof shared in monthly reports</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Your Purchase Data</h2>
          <p>Important privacy information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We do NOT see what you purchase</li>
            <li>We do NOT receive your personal information from Amazon</li>
            <li>Amazon only tells us when a qualifying purchase was made and the commission amount</li>
            <li>Your transaction is private between you and Amazon</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Product Recommendations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>We curate products we believe are valuable</li>
            <li>Product selections are made independently</li>
            <li>We are not paid by brands to feature specific products</li>
            <li>Our only income is standard Amazon affiliate commissions</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>No Influence on Editorial Content</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission to help rescued animals is independent of affiliate earnings. We do not allow affiliate 
            relationships to compromise our mission or transparency commitments.
          </p>
