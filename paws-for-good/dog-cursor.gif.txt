PLACEHOLDER: dog-cursor.gif

This file should be a small animated GIF of a dog paw print or cartoon dog (32x32px recommended).

You can create one using:
1. Free tools like GIPHY or Canva
2. Stock image sites (search "dog cursor animated gif")
3. Commission a simple animation

For now, the cursor will fallback to default if this file is missing.
